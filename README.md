This is the backend file of the course CSCI3280 Introduction to Multimedia Systems provided by The Chinese University of Hong Kong. In this project we are supposed to connect LLM, ASR, and TTS technologies together to create a smart voice chat that allows users to speak into it and get a voice response back. We are team CUDB with members Daniel Yum and Cheung Chiu. Hope you will like our demo!
